# Volley Stats

**Volley Stats** is a comprehensive volleyball match stat tracking application. It allows the user to keep track of player statistics during matches, see a visual representation of how each player performs over the course of a season, along with full team statistics. This will provide coaches with vital information on the performance of players and teams in certain key areas of the game, thus allowing them to understand where improvement is needed either in following training sessions or in real time during the match.

## Project

With this project I am planning to reinforce my skills as a front end developer working with NextJs to create an interactive way of tracking stats within a volleyball match. In terms of new technology I would like to use this opportunity to learn Typescript along with improving my skills with Zustand.
