# Stats app

## Project

With this project I am planning to reinforce my skills as a front end developer working with NextJs to create an interactive way of tracking stats within a volleyball match. In terms of new technology I would like to use this opportunity to learn Typescript along with improving my skills with Zustand.

## Stage 1

- create a basic add player form.
